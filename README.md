#### Description:
###### APPreciate is a social network style app. It's goal is to increase workplace and school productivity as well as improve relationships and the mental health of its users. APPreciate is a web app built on Flask, inspired by Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People. The goal of the App is to increase workplace and classroom productivity and quality of work by promoting positive reinforcement for users. Users can only post things with a positive sentiment score. Users can join "communities" that could be workplace teams, classrooms, companies, schools, or even groups of friends. Users can see posts made in the communities they are a part of. APPreciate fixes the problem of toxic social media interactions and comparison by biasing for positive "appreciation" posts about people. APPreciate aims to provide positive encouragement and reinforcement to users. Company productivity will increase because people are more likely to do a better job if they are being praised for their work, and they are eager to receive praise.
